Plays an assortment of sounds when you die in Path of Exile, also works for anybody in your instance (that is capable of causing the "* has been slain" system message in chat)

You can add more sounds to it by adding them in the project resources, they will be automatically shuffled into the pool of sounds to play. By default, it includes the eponymous "oof" sound, and CD-I Ganon saying "die".
